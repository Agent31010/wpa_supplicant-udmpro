# wpa_supplicant for UDM Pro
This guide has primary been written for authenticating to AT&T U-Verse using wpa_supplicant on a UDM Pro.  This guide assumes you've already retrieved your certificates from a modem supplied by AT&T.  If you have not, you can purchase a used modem on ebay, such as the NVG589 and then root it to get the certificates.  I had success using the following guide.
